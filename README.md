## Specifications of the factory
Our factory will have two steps

### Making dough
To make dough it will take in 'water' and 'flour' to make dough
inputs = 'water' and 'flour'
outputs = 'dough'

### Baking dough
Then, with the dough we should be able to put it in the oven and get out a naan
input = 'dough'
output = 'Naan'

### Factory run
Lastly we should just be able to give the factory the water and flour to get naan
inputs = 'water' and 'flour'
output = 'Naan'
